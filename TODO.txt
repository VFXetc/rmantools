- our RSLTs do not have previews in Maya

- script to regen all of the RfM IDs

- set Reyes to be the default renderer (although this may be better suited to
  be in a ks* repo)

- figure out why our shaders don't automatically connect to the right ports

- shaders:

    - modify GPSurface to add AOVs:
        - DirectIrradiance (per-light)
        - DirectIrradianceNoShadow (per-light)
            - or Shadow (per-light)
        - UnlitTexture
        - Spec (per-light)
        - SpecNoShadow (per-light)
            - or Shador (per-light)

    - can we add a fractional holdout matte into a surface shader?

    - modify RMSShaveHair to add same AOVs.
    - KSMultiAOV
        - a number of colour inputs; no floats required
        - dynamic names
        - single float Matte to multiply them all by
        - single passthrough or AOV int
